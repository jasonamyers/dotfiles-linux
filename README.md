# JAM dotfiles

This is my collection of dot files for my linux systems.
They are HIGHLY OPINIONATED!

To use them:

* git clone it into your home directory
* rename your current .bash_profile .bashrc .vim .vimrc
* run setup.sh

# Setup Xmonad
* git clone git@github.com:davidbrewer/xmonad-ubuntu-conf.git ~/.xmonad
* ~/.xmonad/install-xmonad

# Setup Emacs
This is mostly handled by the setup.sh script; however, you need to start emacs and run:
* M-x jedi:install-server
